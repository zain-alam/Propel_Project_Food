The Food Price Outlook dataset was obtained from data.gov. 
There are food categories with their annual percentage change in food prices across 2020 to 2022 in different columnns. 
My data manipulation involved making new columns that displayed the price change between years and adding it to the main dataset. 
I then made a new dataset by selecting the specific columns that I wanted and graphing it to visually show the food categories with the largest change in price between years.
